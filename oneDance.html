    <p>Baby, I like your style
        Grips on your waist
        Front way, back way
        You know that I don't play
        Streets not safe
        But I never run away
        Even when I'm away
        OT, OT, there's never much love when we go OT
        I pray to make it back in one piece
        I pray, I pray
        That's why I need a one dance
        Got a Hennessy in my hand
        One more time 'fore I go
        Higher powers taking a hold on me
        I need a one dance
        Got a Hennessy in my hand
        One more time 'fore I go
        Higher powers taking a hold on me
        Baby, I like your style
        Strength and guidance
        All that I'm wishin' for my friends
        Nobody makes it from my ends
        I had to bust up the silence
        You know you gotta stick by me
        Soon as you see the text, reply me
        I don't wanna spend time fighting
        We've got no time
        And that's why I need a one dance
        Got a Hennessy in my hand
        One more time 'fore I go
        Higher powers taking a hold on me
        I need a one dance
        Got a Hennessy in my hand
        One more time 'fore I go
        Higher powers taking a hold on me
        Got a pretty girl and she love me long time
        Wine it, wine it, and she love me long time
        Ooh yeah, just steady and wine up
        Back up, back up, back up and wine up
        Back up, back up and wine it
        Girl, just back up, back up, back up and wine down
        Ooh yeah, just steady and wine up
        Back, up, back up and wine it, girl
        Ooh, tell me
        I need to know, where do you wanna go?
        'Cause if you're down, I'll take it slow
        Make you lose control
        Where, where, where
        Where, where, where, where (ooh yeah, very long time)
        (Back, up, back up and wine it, girl)
        'Cause if you're down (back up, back up and)
        'Cause if you're down (back up, back up and)
        'Cause if you're down (back up, back up and)
        I need a one dance
        Got a Hennessy in my hand
        One more time 'fore I go
        Higher powers taking a hold on me
        I need a one dance
        Got a Hennessy in my hand
        One more time 'fore I go
        Higher powers taking a hold on me</p>
