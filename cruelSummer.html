                    Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
        You know that I caught it
        Bad, bad boy
        Shiny toy with a price
        You know that I bought it
        Killing me slow, out the window
        I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
        Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
        What doesn't kill me makes me want you more
        And it's new, the shape of your body
        It's blue, the feeling I've got
        And it's ooh, whoa, oh
        It's a cruel summer
        It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
        No rules in breakable heaven
        But ooh, whoa oh
        It's a cruel summer
        With you
        Hang your head low
        In the glow of the vending machine
        I'm not dying
        You say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
        We're not trying
        So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
        I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
        Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
        And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know
        Oh, it's new, the shape of your body
        It's blue, the feeling I've got
        And it's ooh, whoa, oh
        It's a cruel summer
        It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
        No rules in breakable heaven
        But ooh, whoa, oh
        It's a cruel summer
        With you
        I'm drunk in the back of the car
        And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (oh)
        Said, "I'm fine, " but it wasn't true
        I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
        And I snuck in through the garden gate
        Every night that summer just to seal my fate (oh)
        And I screamed for whatever it's worth
        "I love you, " ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?
        He looks up grinning like a devil
        It's new, the shape of your body
        It's blue, the feeling I've got
        And it's ooh, whoa, oh
        It's a cruel summer
        It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
        No rules, in breakable heaven
        But ooh, whoa, oh
        It's a cruel summer
        With you
        I'm drunk in the back of the car
        And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (oh)
        Said, "I'm fine, " but it wasn't true
        I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
        And I snuck in through the garden gate
        Every night that summer just to seal my fate (oh)
        And I screamed for whatever it's worth
        "I love you, " ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?
        (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
