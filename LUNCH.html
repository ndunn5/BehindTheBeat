    <p>Oh, oh-oh
        I could eat that girl for lunch
        Yeah, she dances on my tongue
        Tastes like she might be the one
        And I could never get enough
        I could buy her so much stuff
        It's a craving, not a crush, huh
        "Call me when you're there"
        Said, "I bought you somethin' rare
        And I left it under 'Claire'"
        So now, she's comin' up the stairs
        So I'm pullin' up a chair
        And I'm puttin' up my hair
        Baby, I think you were made for me
        Somebody write down the recipe
        Been tryin' hard not to overeat
        You're just so sweet
        I'll run a shower for you like you want
        Clothes on the counter for you, try 'em on
        If I'm allowed, I'll help you take 'em off
        (Huh)
        I could eat that girl for lunch
        Yeah, she dances on my tongue
        Tastes like she might be the one
        And I could never get enough
        I could buy her so much stuff
        It's a craving, not a crush, huh
        Oh, I just wanna get her off, oh
        Oh
        Oh, oh
        Oh
        She's takin' pictures in the mirror
        Oh my God, her skin's so clear
        Tell her, "Bring that over here"
        You need a seat? I'll volunteer
        Now she's smilin' ear to ear
        She's the headlights, I'm the deer
        I've said it all before, but I'll say it again
        I'm interested in more than just bein' your friend
        I don't wanna break it, just want it to bend
        Do you know how to bend?
        I could eat that girl for lunch
        She dances on my tongue
        I know it's just a hunch
        But she might be the one
        I could
        Eat that girl for lunch
        Yeah, she
        Tastes like she might be the one
        I could
        I could
        Eat that girl for lunch
        Yeah, she
        Yeah, she
        Tastes like she might be the one</p>
