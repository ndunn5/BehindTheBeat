                <p class="text-center">Uh, me and my niggas tryna get it, ya bish (ya bish, ya bish)
                    Hit the house lick, tell me, is you wit' it, ya bish? (Ya bish, ya bish)
                    Home invasion was persuasive (was persuasive, was persuasive)
                    From nine to five I know it's vacant, ya bish (ya bish, ya bish)
                    Dreams of livin' life like rappers do (like rappers do, like rappers do)
                    Back when condom wrappers wasn't cool (they wasn't cool, they wasn't cool)
                    I fucked Sherane and went to tell my bros (tell my bros, tell my bros)
                    Then Usher Raymond "Let It Burn" came on ("Let Burn" came on, "Let Burn" came on)
                    Hot sauce all in our Top Ramen, ya bish (ya bish, ya bish)
                    Park the car, then we start rhymin', ya bish (ya bish, ya bish)
                    The only thing we had to free our mind (free our mind, free our mind)
                    Then freeze that verse when we see dollar signs (see dollar signs, see dollar signs)
                    You lookin' like an easy come-up, ya bish (ya bish, ya bish)
                    A silver spoon, I know you come from, ya bish (ya bish, ya bish)
                    And that's a lifestyle that we never knew (we never knew, we never knew)
                    Go at a reverend for the revenue
                    It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
                    Pick your poison, tell me what you doin'
                    Everybody gon' respect the shooter
                    But the one in front of the gun lives forever (the one in front of the gun, forever)
                    And I been hustlin' all-day, this-a-way, that-a-way
                    Through canals and alleyways, just to say
                    Money trees is the perfect place for shade, and that's jus' how I feel
                    Nah, nah, a dollar might just fuck your main bitch
                    That's jus' how I feel, nah
                    A dollar might say fuck them niggas that you came with
                    That's jus' how I feel, nah, nah
                    A dollar might just make that lane switch
                    That's jus' how I feel, nah
                    A dollar might turn to a million and we all rich
                    That's jus' how I feel
                    Dreams of livin' life like rappers do (like rappers do, like rappers do)
                    Bump that new E-40 after school (way after school, way after school)
                    You know, "Big Ballin' With My Homies" (my homies)
                    Earl Stevens had us thinkin' rational (thinkin' rational, that's rational)
                    Back to reality, we poor, ya bish (ya bish, ya bish)
                    Another casualty at war, ya bish (ya bish, ya bish)
                    Two bullets in my Uncle Tony head (my Tony head, my Tony head)
                    He said one day I'll be on tour, ya bish (ya bish, ya bish)
                    That Louis Burgers never be the same (won't be the same, won't be the same)
                    A Louis belt that never ease that pain (won't ease that pain, won't ease that pain)
                    But I'ma purchase when that day is jerkin' (that day is jerkin', day is jerkin')
                    Pull off at Church's, with Pirellis skirtin' (Pirellis skirtin', Pirellis skirtin')
                    Gang signs out the window, ya bish (ya bish, ya bish)
                    Hopin' all of 'em offend you, ya bish (ya bish, ya bish)
                    They say yo' hood is a pot o' gold (a pot o' gold, a pot o' gold)
                    And we gon' crash it when nobody's home
                    It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
                    Pick your poison, tell me what you doin'
                    Everybody gon' respect the shooter
                    But the one in front of the gun lives forever (the one in front of the gun, forever)
                    And I been hustlin' all-day, this-a-way, that-a-way
                    Through canals and alleyways, just to say
                    Money trees is the perfect place for shade, and that's jus' how I feel
                    Nah, nah, a dollar might just fuck your main bitch
                    That's jus' how I feel, nah
                    A dollar might say fuck them niggas that you came with
                    That's jus' how I feel, nah, nah
                    A dollar might just make that lane switch
                    That's jus' how I feel, nah
                    A dollar might turn to a million and we all rich
                    That's jus' how I feel
                    Be the last one out to get this dough? No way
                    Love one of you bucket headed hoes? No way
                    Hit the streets, then we break the code? No way
                    Hit the brakes when they on patrol? No way
                    Be the last one out to get this dough? No way
                    Love one of you bucket headed hoes? No way
                    Hit the streets, then we break the code? No way
                    Hit the brakes when they on patrol? No way
                    'Magine Rock up in 'em projects where 'em niggas pick your pockets
                    Santa Claus don't miss 'em stockings, liquors spillin', pistols poppin'
                    Bakin' soda YOLA whippin', ain't no turkey on Thanksgivin'
                    My homeboy just dome'd a nigga, I just hope the Lord forgive him
                    Pots with cocaine residue, every day I'm hustlin'
                    What else is a thug to do when you eatin' cheese from the government?
                    Gotta provide for my daughter 'nem get the fuck-up out my way, bitch
                    Got that drum and I got them bands just like a parade, bitch
                    Drop that work up in the bushes, hope them boys don't see my stash
                    If they do, tell the truth, this the last time you might see my ass
                    From the gardens where the grass ain't cut, them serpents lurkin', Blood
                    Bitches sellin' pussy, niggas sellin' drugs, but it's all good
                    Broken promises, steal your watch and tell you what time it is
                    Take your J's and tell you to kick it where a Foot Locker is
                    In the streets with a heater under my Dungarees
                    Dreams of me gettin' shaded under a money tree
                    It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
                    Pick your poison, tell me what you doin'
                    Everybody gon' respect the shooter
                    But the one in front of the gun lives forever (the one in front of the gun, forever)
                    And I been hustlin' all-day, this-a-way, that-a-way
                    Through canals and alleyways, just to say
                    Money trees is the perfect place for shade, and that's jus' how I feel
                    Kendrick, just bring my car back, man, I-I called in for another appointment
                    I figured you weren't gonna be back here on time anyway
                    Look, shit-shit, I just wanna get out the house, man
                    This man is on one, he feelin' good as a motherfucker
                    Shit, I'm tryna get my thing goin', too, I'm goin' to Merlin' house
                    Just bring my car back, shit, he faded, he feelin' good, look, listen to him (body, I want your body)
                    'Cause you got a big ol' fat ass
                    Girl, girl, I want your body, I want your body, 'cause of that big ol' fat ass
                    (Girl) see, he high as hell, shit, and he ain't even trippin' off them dominoes no more
