                <p class="text-center">Gotta fire my joint up on this bitch
                    Young Metro, Metro, young Metro, three times
                    Yeah
                    Stickin' to the code, all these hoes for the streets
                    I put it in her nose, it's gon' make her pussy leak
                    Pussy niggas told, ain't gon' wake up out they sleep
                    You can't hear that switch, but you can hear them niggas scream
                    All my hoes do shrooms, nigga, all my hoes do coke
                    20-carat ring, I put my fingers down her throat (uh, uh, uh)
                    If I lose a carat, she might choke (uh, uh, uh)
                    I know she gon' swallow, she a G.O.A.T. (uh, uh, uh)
                    Freeband nigga, bring the racks in
                    Got the shooters in the corner like the pack in
                    She think 'cause she exotic bitch, she attractive
                    That's that shit'll get you put up out the section, brrt
                    And the motto still the same
                    Ball like I won a championship game
                    You know these hoes hungry, they gon' fuck for a name
                    I put her on the gang, she get fucked for a chain
                    Got your girl in this bitch, she twirlin' on the dick (he was once a thug, he was, he -)
                    (He was once a thug, he was, he -)
                    I got syrup in this bitch, turn up in this bitch (he was once a thug, he was, he -)
                    And it's 'bout the 'Ercs in this bitch, get murked in this bitch (he was once a thug, he was, he -)

                    Bring a friend, bitch, we fucked 'em at the same time (he was once a thug, he was, he -)
                    I'm a different nigga, no, we not the same kind (he was once a thug, he was, he -)
                    You can have that lil' - 'cause she ain't mine (yeah) (he was once a thug from around the way)
                    Young dope dealer, sellin' dope, is you like that? (If you like that)
                    Kickin' doors, kickin' in doors, is you like that? (Yeah)
                    Young throwed nigga, sellin' lows, is you like that? (Yeah)

                    (He was once a thug from around the way)
                    These niggas talkin' out of they necks
                    Don't pull no coffin out of your mouth
                    I'm way too paranoid for a threat
                    Ayy-ayy, let's get it, bro
                    D-O-T, the money, power, respect
                    The last one is better
                    Say, it's a lot of goofies with a check
                    I mean, ah, I hope them sentiments symbolic
                    Ah, my temperament bipolar, I choose violence
                    Okay, let's get it up, it's time for him to prove that he's a problem
                    Niggas clickin' up, but cannot be legit, no 40 water, tell 'em
                    Ah, yeah, huh, yeah, get up with me (he was once a thug, he was, he -)

                    I crash out, like, "Fuck rap, " this Melle Mel if I had to (he was once a thug, he was, he -)
                    Got two T's with me, I'm snatchin' chains and burnin' tattoos
                    It's up, lost too many soldiers not to play it safe
                    If he walk around with that stick, it ain't Andre 3K
                    Think I won't drop the location? I still got PTSD
                    Motherfuck the big three, nigga, it's just big me
                    Nigga, bum, what? I'm really like that (he was once a thug, he was, he -)

                    Candy banging dope niggas was young, slangin' powder
                    Walk in the strip club, make it rain for three hours
                    Locked in and now I got my Phantom and my driver
                    Perc'd out, took chances in my hood like Nevada
                    Surfed out outside, white interior, lasagna
                    Hundred thousands I just cashed out on designer
                    Gotta devour, nigga, I learned that in the jungle
                    Once I sell this low, that's a million in a week
