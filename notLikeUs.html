                <p class="text-center">… Psst, I see dead people
                    (Mustard on the beat, hoe)
                    … Ayy, Mustard on the beat, hoe
                    Deebo, any rap nigga, he a free throw
                    Man down, call an amberlamps, tell him, "Breathe, bro"
                    Nail a nigga to the cross, he walk around like Teezo
                    What's up with these jabroni-ass niggas tryna see Compton?
                    The industry can hate me, fuck 'em all and they mama
                    How many opps you really got? I mean, it's too many options
                    I'm finna pass on this body, I'm John Stockton
                    … Beat your ass and hide the Bible if God watchin'
                    Sometimes you gotta pop out and show niggas
                    Certified boogeyman, I'm the one that up the score with 'em
                    Walk him down, whole time I know he got some hoe in him
                    Pole on him, extort shit, bully, Death Row on him
                    … Say, Drake, I hear you like 'em young
                    You better not ever go to cell block one
                    To any bitch that talk to him and they in love
                    Just make sure you hide your lil' sister from him
                    They tell me Chubbs the only one that get your hand-me-downs
                    And PARTY at the party, playin' with his nose now
                    And Baka got a weird case, why is he around?
                    Certified Lover Boy? Certified pedophiles
                    … Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, Dot, fuck 'em up
                    Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, I'ma do my stuff
                    Why you trollin' like a bitch? Ain't you tired?
                    Tryna strike a chord and it's probably A-Minor
                    … They not like us, they not like us, they not like us
                    They not like us, they not like us, they not like us
                    … You think the Bay gon' let you disrespect Pac, nigga?
                    I think that Oakland show gon' be your last stop, nigga
                    Did Cole fouI, I don't know why you still pretendin'
                    What is the owl? Bird niggas and bird bitches, go
                    The audience not dumb
                    Shape the stories how you want, hey, Drake, they're not slow
                    Rabbit hole is still deep, I can go further, I promise
                    Ain't that somethin'? B-Rad stands for bitch
                    And you Malibu most wanted
                    … Ain't no law, boy, you ballboy, fetch Gatorade or somethin'
                    Since 2009, I had this bitch jumpin'
                    You niggas'll get a wedgie, be flipped over your boxers
                    What OVO for? The "Other Vaginal Option"? Pussy
                    Nigga better straighten they posture, got famous all up in Compton
                    Might write this for the docket, tell the pop star, "Quit hidin'"
                    Fuck a caption, want action, no accident, and I'm hands-on
                    He fuck around, get polished
                    … Fucked on Wayne girl while he was in jail, that's connivin'
                    Then get his face tatted like a bitch apologizin'
                    I'm glad DeRoz' came home, y'all didn't deserve him neither
                    From Alondra down to Central, nigga better not speak on Serena
                    And your homeboy need subpoena, that predator move in flocks
                    That name gotta be registered and placed on neighborhood watch
                    I lean on you niggas like another line of Wock'
                    Yeah, it's all eyes on me, and I'ma send it up to Pac, ayy
                    … Put the wrong label on me, I'ma get 'em dropped, ayy
                    Sweet Chin Music, and I won't pass the aux, ayy
                    How many stocks do I really have in stock? Ayy
                    One, two, three, four, five, plus five, ayy
                    Devil is a lie, he a 69 God, ayy
                    Freaky-ass niggas need to stay they ass inside, ayy
                    Roll they ass up like a fresh pack of 'za, ayy
                    City is back up, it's a must, we outside, ayy
                    … They not like us, they not like us, they not like us
                    They not like us, they not like us, they not like us
                    … Once upon a time, all of us was in chains
                    Homie still doubled down callin' us some slaves
                    Atlanta was the Mecca, buildin' railroads and trains
                    Bear with me for a second, let me put y'all on game
                    The settlers was usin' town folk to make 'em richer
                    Fast-forward, 2024, you got the same agenda
                    You run to Atlanta when you need a check balance
                    Let me break it down for you, this the real nigga challenge
                    … You called Future when you didn't see the club (ayy, what?)
                    Lil Baby helped you get your lingo up (what?)
                    21 gave you false street cred
                    Thug made you feel like you a slime in your head (ayy, what?)
                    Quavo said you can be from Northside (what?)
                    2 Chainz say you good, but he lied
                    You run to Atlanta when you need a few dollars
                    No, you not a colleague, you a fuckin' colonizer
                    … The family matter, and the truth of the matter
                    It was God's plan to show y'all the liar
                    … Mm
                    Mm-mm
                    He a fan, he a fan, he a fan (mm)
                    He a fan, he a fan, he a-
                    Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God
                    Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God
                    Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life
                    Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life
                    Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God
                    Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God
                    Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life
                    Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life
                    … Let me hear you say, "OV-hoe" (OV-hoe)
                    Say, "OV-hoe" (OV-hoe)
                    Then step this way, step that way
                    Then step this way, step that way
                    … Are you my friend?
                    Are we locked in?
                    Then step this way, step that way
                    Then step this way, step that way
