    <p>Mm, mm, mm
        I try to live in black and white, but I'm so blue
        I'd like to mean it when I say I'm over you
        But that's still not true (blue)
        And I'm still so blue, oh
        I thought we were the same (I thought we were the same)
        Birds of a feather (birds of a feather), now I'm ashamed
        I told you a lie, désolé, mon amour
        I'm trying my best, don't know what's in store
        Open up the door (blue)
        In the back of my mind, I'm still overseas
        A bird in a cage, thought you were made for me
        I try (I'm not what) to live in black and white, but I'm so blue (but I'm not what you need)
        I'd like (not what you need) to mean it when I say I'm over you
        But that's still not true, true
        And I'm still so blue (and it's not true)
        I'm true blue, true blue
        I'm true blue
        mm, mm, mm
        Ah-ah
        Ah-ah-ah-ah
        Ah-ah
        You were born bluer than a butterfly
        Beautiful and so deprived of oxygen
        Colder than your father's eyes
        He never learned to sympathize with anyone
        I don't blame you
        But I can't change you
        Don't hate you (don't hate you)
        But we can't save you (but we can't save you)
        You were born reaching for your mother's hands
        Victim of your father's plans to rule the world
        Too afraid to step outside
        Paranoid and petrified of what you've heard
        But they could say the same 'bout me
        I sleep 'bout three hours each night
        Means only 21 a week now, now
        And I could say the same 'bout you
        Born blameless, grew up famous too
        Just a baby born blue now, now
        I don't blame you (I don't blame you)
        But I can't change you
        Don't hate you
        But we can't save you (we can't save you)
        Ooh-ooh
        It's over now
        It's over now
        It's over now
        (Ah-ah-ah, ah)
        But when can I hear the next one?</p>
