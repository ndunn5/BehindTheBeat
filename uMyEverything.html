                    Showed enough love to the city, I promise, so let's get the fuck out St. Louis
                    Maybe we go to Saint Lucia, I been there, so I'll introduce you
                    Or maybe you go to Saint Martin with me if these niggas take break and quit startin' with me
                    Maybe we go to Saint Kitts, if you and your BD are calling it splits
                    Then maybe we call it an accident, you slip, you trip, you fall on my dick
                    Why you love me? Still a mystery, me and the surgeon got history
                    I changed a lot of girls' lives for real, they need a new body, they hittin' me, ayy

                    The last one, Jung, he did it for free 'cause I sent over so many past ones for him
                    But Red, don't even worry about all of that shit, just keep it natural for 'em, I swear
                    I got a passion for you, I swear, I got attraction for you, I swear
                    Yeah, you think I'm a bachelor, girl, but I swear
                    You ain't get your master's, but I'm still breakin' your back in the master bedroom, I swear
                    You send a pic in them shorts and I had to send you a caption like I was there
                    You the hood bitch of my dreams, Sexyy, girl, you just ask for me and I'm there
                    Bae, I love you, you my everything
                    I'm your main bitch, fuck a wedding ring
                    We both in fast cars and we switchin' lanes (yoom)
                    When I'm away from you, you always on my brain
                    Nigga, we go together, tell them hoes we go together (it's there)
