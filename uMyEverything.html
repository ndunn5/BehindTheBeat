        Give me the pussy, I'm bullyin' shit
        Hit from the back and I'm pullin' your shit
        I had some smoke in the city, I wanted to see you, but, baby, I couldn't just dip
        You know the timin' we on when my niggas start lurkin' and tyin' they hoodies and shit

        Let's do it, Red, girl, I love you, let's do it
        Showed enough love to the city, I promise, so let's get the fuck out St. Louis
        Maybe we go to Saint Lucia, I been there, so I'll introduce you
        Or maybe you go to Saint Martin with me if these niggas take break and quit startin' with me
        Maybe we go to Saint Kitts, if you and your BD are calling it splits
        Then maybe we call it an accident, you slip, you trip, you fall on my dick
        Why you love me? Still a mystery, me and the surgeon got history
        I changed a lot of girls' lives for real, they need a new body, they hittin' me, ayy
        BBL Drizzy, they want a new body, they ask me for it
        The last one, Jung, he did it for free 'cause I sent over so many past ones for him
        But Red, don't even worry about all of that shit, just keep it natural for 'em, I swear
        I got a passion for you, I swear, I got attraction for you, I swear
        Yeah, you think I'm a bachelor, girl, but I swear
        You ain't get your master's, but I'm still breakin' your back in the master bedroom, I swear
        You send a pic in them shorts and I had to send you a caption like I was there
        You the hood bitch of my dreams, Sexyy, girl, you just ask for me and I'm there
        Bae, I love you, you my everything
        I'm your main bitch, fuck a wedding ring
        We both in fast cars and we switchin' lanes (yoom)
        When I'm away from you, you always on my brain
