                <p class="text-center">Nice to meet you, where you been?
                    I could show you incredible things
                    Magic, madness, heaven, sin
                    Saw you there and I thought
                    Oh my God, look at that face
                    You look like my next mistake
                    Love's a game, wanna play? Ayy
                    New money, suit and tie
                    I can read you like a magazine
                    Ain't it funny, rumors fly
                    And I know you heard about me
                    So hey, let's be friends
                    I'm dyin' to see how this one ends
                    Grab your passport and my hand
                    I can make the bad guys good for a weekend
                    So it's gonna be forever
                    Or it's gonna go down in flames
                    You can tell me when it's over, mm
                    If the high was worth the pain
                    Got a long list of ex lovers
                    They'll tell you I'm insane
                    'Cause you know I love the players
                    And you love the game
                    'Cause we're young and we're reckless
                    We'll take this way too far
                    It'll leave you breathless, mm
                    Or with a nasty scar
                    Got a long list of ex lovers
                    They'll tell you I'm insane
                    But I've got a blank space, baby
                    And I'll write your name
                    Cherry lips, crystal skies
                    I could show you incredible things
                    Stolen kisses, pretty lies
                    You're the king, baby, I'm your queen
                    Find out what you want
                    Be that girl for a month
                    Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh no
                    Screaming, crying, perfect storms
                    I can make all the tables turn
                    Rose garden filled with thorns
                    Keep you second guessin' like
                    "Oh my God, who is she?"
                    I get drunk on jealousy
                    But you'll come back each time you leave
                    'Cause darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream
                    So it's gonna be forever
                    Or it's gonna go down in flames
                    You can tell me when it's over, mm
                    If the high was worth the pain
                    Got a long list of ex lovers
                    They'll tell you I'm insane
                    'Cause you know I love the players
                    And you love the game
                    'Cause we're young and we're reckless (oh)
                    We'll take this way too far

                    But I've got a blank space, baby
                    And I'll write your name
                    Boys only want love if it's torture
                    Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
                    Boys only want love if it's torture
                    Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
                    So it's gonna be forever
                    Or it's gonna go down in flames
                    You can tell me when it's over (over), mm
                    If the high was worth the pain
                    Got a long list of ex lovers
                    They'll tell you I'm insane
                    'Cause you know I love the players
                    And you love the game
                    'Cause we're young and we're reckless (yeah)
                    We'll take this way too far
                    It'll leave you breathless, mm
                    Or with a nasty scar
                    Got a long list of ex lovers
